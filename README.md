# shell

A collection of useful general purpose shell scripts

## Getting Started

Most of the scripts are written in bash (4.1.2(1)-release and mainly on GNU/Linux),
but they should function as intended in other shell environments too.

### Prerequisites

GNU/Linux operating system with bash.

```
$ uname -o
GNU/Linux

$ echo $BASH_VERSION
4.1.2(1)-release
```
